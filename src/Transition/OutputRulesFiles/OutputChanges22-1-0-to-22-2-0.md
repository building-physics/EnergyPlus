Output Changes
==============

This file documents the structural changes on the output of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.

### Description

This will eventually become a more structured file, but currently it isn't clear what format is best. As an intermediate solution, and to allow the form to be formed organically, this plain text file is being used. Entries should be clearly delimited.  It isn't expected that there will be but maybe a couple each release at most. Entries should also include some reference back to the repo.  At least a PR number or whatever.

### Template Title

Change description goes here, use links to the PR such as [#9117](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/9117/files).

### SurfaceProperty:GroundSurfaces New Object Output Variables

Two new output variables related to the `SurfaceProperty:GroundSurfaces` have been added along with the new feature development. These new variables are:

- Surfaces Property Ground Surfaces Average Temperature [C]
- Surfaces Property Ground Surfaces Average Reflectance []
